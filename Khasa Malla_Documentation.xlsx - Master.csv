N.D.D.1,Nepal,Dailekh,Dullu,,Stele,"Alongside the Kritikhama there were 7 other pillars of different sizes spread out throughout a gated enclosure (one of them was outside). These were of varying sizes but some had a similar capital on top. One of the inscriptions on the pillar of Dapumala is claimed to be the old inscription in Nepal. These pillars seems to lead(?) to the Kritikhamba, which is fenced and has a tin roof on top of it. The northern face has the Khasa Malla line, while the southern face contains the Pala line. Behind, there is a translation of the pillar in Nepali and citations as well. Pillars are all slightly titled. Measurements from the base, starting with pillars at the gate and moving towards the kritistambha are: Pillar 1 (outside of the gate) - 30x109 / Pillar 2 - 28x131 / Pillar 3 (with the Nepali on the face) - 22x73 / Pillar 4 - 30x119 / Pillar 5 - 29x65 / Pillar 6 - 26x67 / Pillar 7 - 27x124 / Kritikhamba - 50x266 ","The lineage of the kings of Yatse is drawn from the so-called Dullu inscription, the most comprehensive list of the dynasty so far located in an Indic source. This inscription is recorded on a stele (kīrtistambha), roughly 2.5 metres tall, which gives a dynastic list that matches that found in Tibetan chronicles. At the top of the stele is a Buddhist symbol and the famous invocation to Avalokiteshvara — Om mani padme hum — the inscription also bears the name of the scribe who composed it, who sometimes attempts brief outburst of verse inspired by conventional Indian themes. Although, the links Indian culture were slight, what is interesting is that the connection and cohabitation of Hindu cultural tradition and Buddhist symbols are on the same stele. // In Adhikary's work the inscription is B-27.

,Nepal,Surkhet,Birendranagar,,Vihara,Series of scattered remains around the vihara with some at the museum. Parts of the statues are re-done. Next time you go back get the old man at the counter a copy of Yogi Narharinath's book. ,"Despite being the oldest temple in Surkhet, Kakre Vihar remained concealed in the forest for centuries, only to be rediscovered by archaeologists in the 20th century. // The excavation and renovation of the temple commenced over five decades ago, following a visit by King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah, who allocated resources for its protection and restoration. The choice of the name of Kankra Vihar may be sigmificant. Vihar is the term used in India for monastery and Kankre is a phonetic variant on the term chakra, used in an integral part of Buddhist Tantra. The name suggests that worship at the temple might have involved the three Buddhist chakras and was part of what Adrian Snodgrass calls the 'interior ascent.' The proposition is strengthened by more than 200 pillars stones found along the ancient pilgrimage route from India to Surkhet and nortwards to Simikot, Taklakot, Kailash. 40% of these pillar stones have Buddhist texts or symbols (1). The exact provenance of the temple and its building date are uncertain but it seems probable that it was built in the 13th century by one of the Khasa Kings, possibly Ashoka Challa. It was a time when Buddhism was still the paramount religion in West Nepal though slowly falling under the influence of Hinduism. Nonetheless, it is clear from the deities carved for the new temple that it was intented to celebrate and promote Buddhism and also, in an even-handed way op recognize the importance of Hinduism (2).","Saturday, January 25, 2025",1,,,"Sambid Bilas Pant — Karnali Blues:  A Journey Through Surkhet, Jajarkot, and Rara (Online) // T.B Harward — A Historical Survey of the Surkhet Valley (1 & 2)"

The second pillar — on the other side of the road — has been split into two. The bottom half that (Andolfatto documented) has been joined together with its other part by drilling through the pillars and installing a rod through it. The most significant find as the horse capital that rested on top of pillar 1 on the left side of the road. This is kept at the Jaleshwor temple and is still in good condition. ,The significance of these four pillars stones lay in their age and location; in the fact that they had survived and were now unconciously markers of the ancient route to the south (14)...In our medieval context this emphasises the real importance of the route and the fact that the four pillar stones were still its markers (14).,"Sunday, January 26, 2025",1,,,T.B Harward — A Historical Survey of the Surkhet Valley (14)

,Nepal,Surkhet,Mangalgadhi,,Fort ,"I was able to find a pillar with very faint inscriptions that I think says Ananda Malla. The Shiva temple is more recent, it was completed about 30 years ago. The pillar bearing the inscription is kept alongside another pillar with a long horziontal stone beam with what looked to be some sort of gajjur on top. I am not sure if all of these belonged to the same structure, they could be from an older temple?","The fort site is close to the road running from bazaar to Laitikoli. Its strategic position is thus self-evident. It is well placed to control all movments in and out of the town, especially travellers, traders pilgrims proceeding to and from Dullu / Dailekh, and also to India. It was therefore politically and commerically important as well as having a defensive role in respect of Dullu, the winter palace of the Khas Malla (18). We also speculated on whether it had been built at the same time as Latikoili temple when the then rulers of Dailekh had built or refurbished an earlier version in 1582.According to Joshi, a one line stone inscription which mentions the name 'Ananda Malla'  was found in the Mangalgadhi complex, though it does not appear to bear any date or other detail. It can be inferred that it was already constructed during the reign of Ananda Malla who as the second son of Asoka Challa and the brother of Jitari Malla. If this statement is true or if new information becomes avaliable to verify this claim, then it can be said that the fort was constructed during the time of the Khasa Malla. In which case, both temples would most likely have been built after the fall of Kankre Vihar, or at least one of them. This would give a possible building sequence as: Kankra Vihar (13th - 14th century AD), Mangalgadhi (15th century AD), and than Latikoili (16th century AD) (19).

Here Prthvimalla is mentioned as a great religious king (parama dharmika) and an embodiment of the wish-giving tree (parama kalpadrumavatarxa). This is important because Prthvimalla is most likely deriving his idea of “religious king” from the Buddhist idea of Chakravartin (B-23). The Patharanauli stupa is built on the roof of a large structure of the nauli (Fig. 15) made of large and massive stone blocks.

,Nepal,Dailekh,Padukasthan (Dullu),,Temple Complex / Vir Pillars,"Padukasthan is a complex of temples / sculptures / architectural elements lying around. Once you enter and descend down the stairs you reach a collection of small shivalingas and reliefs of gods scattered around. Notably, on the day of our visit, most of the sculptures had oil applied on them, which according to the caretaker of the temple was to make them look nice. There are multiple shivalingas on the floor, and what looked to the the capitals of the Khasa pillars. One theory I am starting to develop is that the Khasa pillars might have been repurposed and potentially made into shivalingas. There were also reliefs of gods, which look much more inidigenous in comparison to modern, more standardized images of Hindu gods. Most significantly, there is a Buddha relief, in the bhumisparsha mudra, and sitting on a geometrical lotus base, carved on to a niche. This Buddha does not look like the one found in Kankrevihar, which according to Andolfatto is in the Mark-Gujjar style, but has a much more slender and geometrical composition. The inscriptions seems to read that it was from the time of Krachalla. Interestingly, the priest of the temple said that the Buddha relief was not always there and that it was Yogi Narharinath, after a dream, that got the villagers together and moved the relief from the river bank to where it is now. Yogi Narharinath also said that there were 3 more. All of these according to the priest / caretaker were on the banks of the river, but were washed away when there was a flood in 2007 BS. The caretaker point out parts of an old temple that still lay face down along the river banks — this might be an interesting place to do an archaeological excavation. As you go down there is a tree, which has a collection of broken sculptures, ranging from the bottom half of a Buddha in the bhumisparsha mudra, the bottom half of a shiva, multiple bulls, lions that are very similar to the ones I saw in front of the Dullu museum, and circular stones with an imprint of what looks like the dharma chakra / loutses. There are also a litany of Hindu gods — like the Suryamukhi — in very good condition in the same area. Once you take a left from the living quarters of the priest / caretaker, you reach the modern jwala ghar (which no longer has a jwala or flame) and was built during a visit by King Birendra. Interestingly, anything that is old is credited to the Pandavs. All the stone slabs around the Padukasthan complex are remains of the old jwala ghar. Slightly behind the jwala ghar is the bottom half of a dewal — top half seems to have fallen off. If you keep walking, without turning towards the jwala ghar — there is another enclosure with a collection of sculptures and more louts bases. I've taken photos of the spiral motifs on the pillars — will be worth it to compare with the other pillars I've come across and see if there was some sort of uniformity in design.
